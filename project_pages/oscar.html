            This project was my capstone project for the Uniersity of Waterloo. With a team of 4 
            other people we
            created a working autonomous marine rescue robot that could use GPS and a waterproofed
            thermal camera to detect and drive to overboard victims. The craft could then broadcast
            its GPS coordinates, flash lights, and provide flotation to the victim, keeping them
            safe while recuers were guided to them.

            I worked on all aspects of the craft and owned the software architecture, sensor 
            drivers, sensor fusion, and controls algorithms. I also performed PCB design reviews,
            designed small mechanical components, oversaw the waterproof penetrators for keeping 
            the electrical enclosures dry, and fabricated wires.

            I also pitched OSCAR at the Velocity pitch competition and Norman Esch pitch
            competition. My pitch at the Norman Esch competition led to us being selected as a
            winning team.
