            This project began as the unicycle robot that I also have listed in my portfolio. This
            second iteration is a challenge to create a balancing robot that rests on free spinning
            wheels. The robot will balance using a flywheel with an acceleration-based pitch 
            balancing system that I have been designing the controller for. Yaw control will come
            from the ability to roll the flywheel and use the inertia of the flywheel.
            Once the robot balances well I may add a propellor to the back so that it can drive and
            move while still maintaining the non-actuated wheels.

            The first version of this robot involved a BLDC motor attached to a heavy flywheel made
            of a wheel acting as the weight and an adaptor to connect it to the motor. A 2S LiPo
            battery connected to a BEC (Battery Elimination Circuit) was used to power the 
            controlling microcontroller and IMU, in addition to an ESC that powered the BLDC motor.

            The first spin test failed rather quickly when the plastic adaptor piece to connect the
            wheel to the BLDC motor ripped apart at high speeds.

            I then redesigned the flywheel to be a metal washer with a stronger 3D printed adaptor
            that survived the spin test (now performed in a brick enclosure). Unfortunately the
            test revealed that the inertia of the flywheel was causing issues with the ESC leading 
            to a loss of speed control and the BLDC motor was far too powerful for the use case.

        <p class="project-page-text">
            The next step for this project will be to use a lower-speed likely brushed DC motor for
            the flywheel and possibly use a PCB that I designed for my <a class="frontpage-link" href="./project_pages/snake_bot.html">snake robot</a>
            to power the robot.
