            A small project to create a unicycle robot that can balance on one geared wheel.
            I had 4 motors that would attach to the center of the robot. Three of the motors would
            connect to weights and would be rotated to correct the pitch, roll, and yaw
            respectively. The fourth motor is connected by gears to the bottom wheel. Having both 
            a pitch motor and an actuated wheel allows the robot to pitch and drive as one motor 
            controls the pitch and the other keeps the robot upright.

            I developed the project to the point of creating a balancing robot that could balance
            only in the pitch direction with the driving gear. I decided to stop this project and
            begin the flywheel gyroscopic robot as using a common method to balance in multiple 
            directions felt less interesting. I find rolling the flywheel to be a more novel system.
