            Beginning as a project with some friends "Larry" was a hexapod robot that would consist
            of 12 motors controlling a 6-legged robot. Designed mechanically to require minimal 3D
            printer filament to make the design is very simplistic and based on a spider.
        </p>
        <embed type="image/png" class="project-page-img" src="../resources/LarryV2.png">
        <p class="project-page-text">
            The first version of Larry (shown above) had issues with how the servo motors were
            mounted so further versions were designed to more securely mount the hip motors.
        </p>
        <p class="project-page-text">
            After the first design I worked on a staged stepping system that would allow the robot
            to walk around. I then looked at gaussian profiles to match combined and organic 
            motions to allow Larry to walk more like a spider than a jerky robot.
        </p>
        <p class="project-page-text">
            Once the stepping system seemed to work on disconnected servo motors I began to build
            out the functionality writing functions that let the robot turn, reset the position of
            its legs, bow, and shake itself from side to side. Unfortunately this was as far as the 
            project got as school left not enough time to continue.

        <p class="project-page-text">
            Likely my biggest lasting impact on my university is my design of the Uwaterloo
            Engineering Pin. An open call was put out for submissions for the design of a new
            engineering pin that all incoming engineering students would recieve similar to the
            iron rings that we recieve upon graduation.
        </p>

        <p class="project-page-text">
            My design (shown above) <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/engineering-students/defining-moment">was selected</a> 
            by a vote of the student body as the new design
            and I worked with the dean and department on the creation of the pin. I was later given
            the honor of receiving the first iron pin given out.
        </p>
        <p class="project-page-text">
            Later I was contacted and I talked with the machinists when the creation of multiple
            larger versions of the pin were designed. First a 6-inch version was made for the Dean
            of Engineering, a 2-foot diameter pin (shown below) was made to be hung on the wall of 
            an engineering building and there was talk of a 1-foot version to be made in the
            future.
            With the larger format I was able to reintroduce the chamfers of the iron ring that 
            were unable to be manufactured for the iron pins.
