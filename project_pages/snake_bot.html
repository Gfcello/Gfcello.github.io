            This project began as an idea to work on forward and inverse kinematics and to explore 
            organic motions in a larger project. I have worked on industrial robotic arms at 
            Kindred Robotics (now a part of Ocado), but I wanted to create a system from scratch 
            with more joints and the ability to move and eventually climb.

            The first version of the snake included 2 wheel systems that I designed a gear system
            for to allow the wheels to turn and drive in any direction with no breaks in driving.

            I designed the gear system to ensure that the turning and driving motors stayed
            stationary and the two sets of gears stayed engaged.

            This section included cutouts for power and motor signal wires, used slots for nuts and
            holes for M3 screws to connect top and bottom sections. Because the wheel assembly 
            would be contained in this link the joint motors would be part of the adjacent links.

            3D rinting this link showed a few issues with the design. First, the link was larger 
            that would be reasonable for the servo motors to move. Through some moment math and
            weighing the section it was clear that the links needed to be smaller and lighter.
            The second issue was that the driving gear teeth were too thin for a reliable 
            connection with the wheel.
        </p>
        <p class="project-page-text">
            Around the time of this I lost my school license to SolidWorks, so I decided to
            redesign the snake using SolidEdge, a similar piece of software that is free for hobby
            use. I also had come across a 
            <a class="frontpage-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCtXsTaEscM">video by computerphile</a>
            about a snake robot that talked about different methods of locomotion that convinced me
            to remove the wheels entirely and take on the challenge of a mobile robot without 
            wheels or legs.
        </p>
        <p class="project-page-text">
            To make my snake robot mobile I needed to power each of the 10 high-torque motors I
            planned to use in addition to the Respberry Pi Zero and sensors I was using. To make 
            the snake as light and small as possible I settled on using a 4S LiPo battery in the
            tail of the robot. I would then design my own chaining buck converter PCB to power
            the motors and components at a 5V level.
        </p>
        <embed type="image/png" class="project-page-img" src="../resources/SnakeBuckDesign.png">
        <p class="project-page-text">
            I used the TI Webench Power Designer to design a buck circuit and began to create my
            power circuit using KiCad. I also decided to use a PCA9685 board to generate the motor
            control signals as the Raspberry Pi Zero cannot handle 10 hardware PWM signals.
        </p>
        <p class="project-page-text">
            Because all of the PWM signals are originating from one place and then being run along 
            the length of the snake, electrical interference was a concern, so I added a signal
            cleaning circuit consisting of a low-pass filter and a Schmitt Trigger to the back of
            the PCB. I also added pads for bypassing resistors for the back circuit and some bulk
            electrolytic capacitors to the 5V output to handle current spikes from the servo motors.
        </p>

        <p class="project-page-text">
            With the echematic completed I worked on the layout attempting to maximize the area of
            the copper to pass through the battery ground and voltage leads as the battery power is
            chained through the length of the snake and minimizing resistance is key for efficiency.

            Once the PCBs arrived I went through the process of using a stencil and solder paste to
            reflow and add all the components for the power circuit first. 
            First I used an incorrect temperature to try to reflow a board, but after I corrected 
            the temperature the reflow went better.
            
            I did run into issues with 
            two of the boards having short circuits under the very tiny buck chip, but taking the 
            chip off and resoldering it fixed the issue for both boards. I now had boards that
            were outputting 5V when they recieved 12-16V.

        <p class="project-page-text">
            I then populated the signal cleaning circuits on not all of the boards as the board 
            that powere the Raspberry Pi will not need the back circit.

        <p class="project-page-text">
            Next I populated the through-hold PCB components. I noticed that I had flipped the 
            signal and 5V outputs to the motors at this point, so I unfortunately couldn't directly
            plug the servo motors into the boards (if I make more I will fix this). In the mean
            time I either soldered the regular headers with extra jumper wires or soldered cut 
            wires directly to allow the motors to plug in. Each motor can draw up to 2.4A of
            current at the peak, so the wires used were selected as tehy are rated for 6A of peak 
            current.

        <p class="project-page-text">
            Now with working PCBs I tested running motors and began assembly of the robot as I 
            3D printed the second version of the snake which was much slimmer.

        <p class="project-page-text">
            With 5 PCB links, 4 servo links, a head, and a tail, the snake is well over a meter 
            long and so care was taken when managing wires and making the plugs to chain the
            battery power lines from PCB to PCB. I used XT60 conectors as they could handle more
            current than I needed and that was a standard for the batteries.
